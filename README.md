I employed KERAS' pretrained MobileNet CNN and fine-tuned it for our particular flood detection (image classification) task.

Normal or No Flooding images were collected from google image search, there may be irrelevant images in this category because the images were downloaded using an automated script.

The trained model performed quite impressively and got an accuracy score of over 98% and it was only trained for about 5 minutes.
